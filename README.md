  ## Project Description
    My motivation for this project was to find ways to easily execute all functions using express and mongoose with mongoDB for a social media website. In this project some of the problems I solved were:

        Using modular code to set up routes through many directories
        Use insomnia to test routes
        Use mongoose syntax to execute functions

  ## Installation
  This being a node.js app, you must first make sure your terminal can run this app by aquiring the needed packages. You will need npm installed, You will also need Mongoose installed.You will then need express. Once those dependencies are fitted, you're ready to begin usage.

  ## Usage
 To begin, open your terminal within the root directory, or if you're using VS code, open an integrated terminal. You then type "npm start" on the command line to begin.
