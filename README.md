  ## Project Description
  My motivation for this projects was to find ways to easily execute all functions using express and mongoose with mongoDB for a social media website. I used Insomnia to check may code.

    
  ## Installation
  This being a node.js app, you must first make sure your terminal can run this app by aquiring the needed packages. You will need npm installed, You will also need Mongoose installed.You will then need express. Once those dependencies are fitted, you're ready to begin usage.
